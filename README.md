# TicTacToe Board Game
C# Project

The objective of this Project is to gain practical experience with object-oriented software
development through object modelling with design diagrams and applying standard software
design principles and patterns. This understanding is to be demonstrated by creating and
documenting an object-oriented design and implement it using C# for a larger real-world
motivated problem.
